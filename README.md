## Features

- 🎵 Full-screen music player modal with gesture controls
- 🔄 Smooth scaling animations of the root content
- 👆 Interactive pan gesture handling
- 📱 iOS-style sheet presentation
- 🎨 Dynamic border radius animations
- 🌟 Visual audio visualizer
- 💫 Haptic feedback on modal interactions
- 🖼️ Blur effects and backdrop filters
- 📱 Sticky mini-player navigation
- 📋 Apple Music style track listing
- ⚡ Gesture handling with drag thresholds
- 🔄 Horizontal swipe to dismiss

## Tech Stack

- [Expo](https://expo.dev) - React Native development platform
- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) - File-based routing
- [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) - Smooth animations
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/) - Native-driven gesture handling

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Open in iOS Simulator or Android Emulator:
   - Press `i` for iOS
   - Press `a` for Android

## Implementation Details

The project showcases several key features of modern React Native development:

- Shared element transitions between mini and full player
- Gesture-based interactions with multi-axis support
- Context-based animation state management
- Worklet-based animations for optimal performance

### Known Issues

- Horizontal drag gesture conflicts with content scrolling when the modal is partially scrolled, causing flickering. This needs to be addressed by properly managing gesture priorities and scroll state.
